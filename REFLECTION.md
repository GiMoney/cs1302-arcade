 1. **DONE:** We finished up all the finishing touches to our games. For 2048, we completed the score
    fuctionality of the game and fixed some bugs that happend. With Space Invaders, we finished up the visual
    style of it and some bugs that included invincibility lasting too long the aliens not moving around correctly.
    We also completed the EXTRA CREDIT for the animated intro for our main arcade app.

 2. **PROB:** We attempted to do the high score table for the game but we could figure out how to read our
    files. In 2048, we had some trouble with threads not working correctly with the EventDispatch thread. As mentioned
    above, in Space Invaders there was an issue with invinciblity frames.

 1. **DONE:** We have gotten a lot of work done and just need to do more in Space Invaders
    and a little more to complete 2048. We also implemented the starting screen
    that shows the two buttons to swap between scenes. Specifically with each game,
    Space Invaders has some progress with all the assets and the monsters and how the general
    layout of the game is. In 2048, the game moves and merges around perfectly (except for some
    minor problems).

 2. **TODO:** For 2048, we need to finish up implementing the high score, win and lose
    conditions, and general improvement when running it with threads. For Space Invaders, we have
    to complete the movement, finish up hit detection with bullets, and bug fixes. Also need
    to beautify the main screen to be more presentable.

 3. **PROB:** Gi is still having trouble moving the monsters and fixing up the bullet and
    hit detection for the bullets. Kyle is trying to deal with "empty moves" in 2048 when an illegal
    move spawns another random tile. Overall peformance needs to improve also.

 1. **DONE:** We got a bit of work done mainly on 2048 and space invaders. Kyle managed to combine and merge
    2 boxes into a 4, which is great progress. Gi managed to fill in some fo the code mainly for
    creating the player and the monsters as well as added the win and lose situations. In addtion, Gi added
    a live and point system. We both have done better with working at the correct meeting times and mangaed
    to help look and give feedback on each other's code, which was very helpful.

 2. **TODO:** Start to implement the main menu and create an appealing interface with the ability to switch
    between both Space invaders and 2048. I need to makes sure that the code actually works properly, since
    I was not able to fully test it. Need to get space invaders running smoothly.
    
 3. **PROB:** I had  a hard time moving all the tiles together in 2048
    and remember to commit with the tag. Had a hard time getting space
    invaders to run and show key components such as the player or the monster.
    Also haveing a hard time with the shooting method.
    I need to make, including detecting when it hits.

1. **DONE:** We have decided to do the 2048 and Space Invaders games. Kyle will
   focus on the 2048 game while Gi focuses on the Space Invaders game. However, we
   will still be checking each other. We have discussed how each game will be
   structured and have created the repository, downloaded the skeleton code, and
   have begun the beginning files and code for 2048.

2. **TODO:** Beginning files and code for the Space Invaders game and hopefully
   have a basic running 2048 game that has most of the assets compelete and ready
   to test. Also further test the 2048 game and add more features.

3. **PROB:** We had difficulty structuring the 2048 game in the beginning, resulting
   in us restarting the code due to seeing problems in the future with our current strategy.
