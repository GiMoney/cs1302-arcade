1. **DONE:** We have decided to do the 2048 and Space Invaders games. Kyle will
   focus on the 2048 game while Gi focuses on the Space Invaders game. However, we
   will still be checking each other. We have discussed how each game will be
   structured and have created the repository, downloaded the skeleton code, and
   have begun the beginning files and code for 2048.

2. **TODO:** Beginning files and code for the Space Invaders game and hopefully
   have a basic running 2048 game that has most of the assets compelete and ready
   to test. Also further test the 2048 game and add more features.

2. **DONE:** Decided on the 2 games to work on. Group 1: Space Invaders Group 2: 2048
    
3. **TODO:** Finish reading the project description.

4. **PROB:** Had a hard time scheduling physicial meetings with each other at
   first, but now that we've settled on a regular day/time things are looking
   great!

3. **PROB:** We had difficulty structuring the 2048 game in the beginning, resulting
   in us restarting the code due to seeing problems in the future with our current
   strategy. Busy week of testing has resulted in us having hard time meeting.
