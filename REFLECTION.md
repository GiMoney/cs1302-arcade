 1. **DONE:** We got a bit of work done mainly on 2048 and space invaders. Kyle managed to combine and merge
    2 boxes into a 4, which is great progress. Gi managed to fill in some fo the code mainly for
    creating the player and the monsters as well as added the win and lose situations. In addtion, Gi added
    a live and point system. We both have done better with working at the correct meeting times and mangaed
    to help look and give feedback on each other's code, which was very helpful.

 2. **TODO:** Start to implement the main menu and create an appealing interface with the ability to switch
    between both Space invaders and 2048. I need to makes sure that the code actually works properly, since
    I was not able to fully test it. Need to get space invaders running smoothly.
    
 3. **PROB:** I had  a hard time moving all the tiles together in 2048
    and remember to commit with the tag .
        
 4. **PROB:** Had a hard time getting space invaders to run and show key components
    such as the player or the moster. Also haveing a hard time with the shooting method
    I need to make, including detecting when it hits

1. **DONE:** We have decided to do the 2048 and Space Invaders games. Kyle will
   focus on the 2048 game while Gi focuses on the Space Invaders game. However, we
   will still be checking each other. We have discussed how each game will be
   structured and have created the repository, downloaded the skeleton code, and
   have begun the beginning files and code for 2048.

2. **TODO:** Beginning files and code for the Space Invaders game and hopefully
   have a basic running 2048 game that has most of the assets compelete and ready
   to test. Also further test the 2048 game and add more features.

<<<<<<< HEAD
2. **DONE:** Decided on the 2 games to work on. Group 1: Space Invaders Group 2: 2048
    
3. **TODO:** Finish reading the project description.

4. **PROB:** Had a hard time scheduling physicial meetings with each other at
   first, but now that we've settled on a regular day/time things are looking
   great!


=======
3. **PROB:** We had difficulty structuring the 2048 game in the beginning, resulting
   in us restarting the code due to seeing problems in the future with our current
   strategy. Busy week of testing has resulted in us having hard time meeting.
